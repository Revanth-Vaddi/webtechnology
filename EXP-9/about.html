<h1> HELLO!! WELCOME TO TWITTER </h1>
<p>Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service owned by American company Twitter, 
    Inc.,<br> on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, <br>
    like, and retweet tweets, while unregistered users only have a limited ability to read public tweets. <br>
    Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its APIs. <br>
    Prior to April 2020, services were accessible via SMS.[8] Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, <br>
    but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017.[9] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds 
    for most accounts.</p>
